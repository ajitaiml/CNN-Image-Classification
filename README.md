# ðŸ”¥ CNN Image Classification

A deep learning project focused on classifying images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This project leverages TensorFlow for model building and training, and OpenCV for image preprocessing, supporting multiple emotion categories.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements a deep learning-based image classification system using a CNN, powered by TensorFlow and OpenCV. It categorizes images into different emotional states (e.g., happy, sad) by preprocessing images with OpenCV and training a robust model with TensorFlow, with options for CPU-only processing.
